  <h2>Profile:</h2>
  <p class ="AV">Experienced Project Coordinator with a background in E-Ordering and the pharmaceutical industry. I
have over eight years of experience leading teams and delivering results for complex projects. While at
Nikon Optical Canada, I worked as the IT Coordinator, where I was responsible for initiating, planning,
executing, tracking and closing IT projects. My role included managing and updating the optical lens
database, for the online ordering platform. Before returning to school in 2016, I was a successful
pharmaceutical representative and manager, leading teams and delivering results for complex projects.
While at Merck and Novo Nordisk, I demonstrated a consistent ability to exceed expectations due to my
leadership and ability to organize and manage several projects at once. In 2013, I received the Novo Nordisk
Circle of Excellence Award. In 2014, I was promoted to District Business Manager, where I was
responsible for leading a team of 9 sales representatives. I have an AEC in Computer Network Management,
as well as a Bachelor Degree in Psychology and M.Sc. Neuroscience. Presently, I am working on achieving
a certificate in Project Management from Sheridan College, Ontario. With my experience and passion for
growth, I hope to make a positive impact at Canadian Tire.</p>
